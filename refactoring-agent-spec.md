# AI Refactoring Agent: Technical Specification

[Claude Project](https://claude.ai/chat/65ae8399-ae0f-4fac-ba3b-d730ad081df7)

## 1. Overview
The AI Refactoring Agent is a GitHub Action that automatically analyzes repositories and suggests code refactorings as pull requests. It runs on a nightly schedule, identifying potential improvements to code quality without requiring manual developer intervention. The system leverages GitHub's built-in AI capabilities to ensure code never leaves the GitHub infrastructure.

### 1.1 Objectives
- Automate the identification and suggestion of code refactorings
- Reduce technical debt through continuous, incremental improvements
- Minimize security risks by keeping all code within GitHub's infrastructure
- Provide clear, actionable pull requests that developers can easily review

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Implementation Approach
- **Platform**: GitHub Action
- **AI Processing**: GitHub Copilot for PRs API / GitHub-hosted AI models
- **Execution Schedule**: Configurable (default: nightly)
- **Authentication**: Native GitHub permissions system

### 2.2 Required Permissions
- Read-only code access
- Ability to create branches
- Ability to create pull requests
- Write access to repository contents (limited to created branches)
- Workflow permissions (for scheduled execution)

### 2.3 Workflow
1. Action runs on schedule (nightly by default)
2. Scans repository for refactoring opportunities
3. Groups similar refactorings by type
4. Creates branches for each refactoring type
5. Applies changes to respective branches
6. Creates PRs with detailed descriptions
7. Adds appropriate labels and categorization

## 3. Feature Requirements

### 3.1 Core Functionality
- **Supported Languages** (initial):
  - Python
  - TypeScript

- **Refactoring Types** (initial):
  - Variable renaming for clarity
  - Code formatting improvements
  - Simple method extraction
  - Removal of duplicate code
  - Dead code elimination
  - Simple structural improvements

- **Pull Request Organization**:
  - Single-concern PRs focused on one refactoring type
  - Limited to 5-10 files maximum per PR
  - Descriptive titles and detailed explanations
  - Consistent labeling system

### 3.2 Configuration
- **Setup**: YAML configuration file (`.github/workflows/ai-refactor.yml`)
- **Configurable Options**:
  - Schedule frequency
  - Included/excluded directories
  - Enabled refactoring types
  - PR creation limits

### 3.3 User Experience
- Simple, minimal configuration required
- Clear documentation with setup instructions
- Example configurations for common scenarios
- Descriptive PR templates

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 High Priority (Phase 1)
- **Secrets Protection**:
  - Pattern detection to identify and skip files containing potential secrets
  - Exclusion of configuration files, credential files, and environment variables
  - Regular expression patterns for common secret formats

- **Code Integrity Safeguards**:
  - Signed GitHub Action with trusted certificate
  - Checksum verification
  - Publication through verified GitHub marketplace

- **AI Processing Transparency**:
  - Documentation of GitHub's model usage
  - Clear terms about data retention
  - No external data transmission

- **Repository Access Controls**:
  - Configuration options for restricting to specific directories
  - Exclusion patterns for sensitive areas
  - Default skipping of common sensitive directories

- **Audit Logging**:
  - Detailed logs of all analyzed files
  - Records of suggested refactoring types
  - Accessible logs for repository owners

### 4.2 Medium Priority (Phase 2)
- **Resource Protection**:
  - Rate limiting on processing volume
  - PR creation limits
  - Configurable thresholds

- **Security Scanning Integration**:
  - Verification that refactorings don't introduce vulnerabilities
  - Integration with existing security tools

## 5. Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Phase 1 (MVP)
1. Set up basic GitHub Action structure
2. Implement GitHub AI integration
3. Develop core Python and TypeScript refactoring capabilities
4. Create PR generation and organization system
5. Implement high-priority security measures
6. Develop configuration system
7. Create documentation and examples

### 5.2 Timeline Estimates
- GitHub Action setup and configuration: 1-2 weeks
- AI integration and refactoring rules: 2-3 weeks
- PR generation system: 1-2 weeks
- Security measures: 1-2 weeks
- Testing and refinement: 2 weeks
- Documentation: 1 week

**Total MVP Development**: 8-12 weeks

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Test Repository Scenarios
- Small, medium, and large repositories
- Simple and complex codebases
- Various code quality levels
- Multiple language combinations

### 6.2 Test Types
- **Functional Testing**:
  - Verification of refactoring accuracy
  - PR creation and formatting
  - Configuration options

- **Security Testing**:
  - Verification of secret detection
  - Validation of permission boundaries
  - Audit log accuracy

- **Performance Testing**:
  - Repository size handling
  - Processing time measurement
  - Resource consumption monitoring

### 6.3 Quality Metrics
- Percentage of accepted PRs
- Developer feedback ratings
- False positive rate
- Processing time per repository size

## 7. Future Work

### 7.1 Expanded Feature Set
- Support for additional languages (Java, JavaScript, C#, Go, Ruby)
- Advanced refactoring types (architectural improvements, design patterns)
- Integration with additional Git platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Enhanced customization options
- Analytics dashboard
- IDE plugins and integration ecosystem
- Enterprise features

### 7.2 Open Questions
- **User Adoption Strategy**: 
  - How to encourage teams to install and use the action
  - Optimal onboarding experience
  - Addressing potential developer resistance

- **Business Model** (if applicable):
  - Free, freemium, or paid service options
  - Success metrics definition

- **Git Workflow Compatibility**:
  - Compatibility with different Git workflows
  - Handling of branching strategies and protected branches

- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Managing conflicts with other automated tools
  - Handling concurrent PRs affecting the same code

- **Large Repository Support**:
  - Handling very large codebases or monorepos
  - Performance optimizations for scale

- **User Feedback Loop**:
  - Collecting and incorporating user feedback
  - Learning which refactorings are most valuable

## 8. Dependencies and Requirements

### 8.1 Development Requirements
- GitHub Actions development environment
- Access to GitHub Copilot for PRs API
- Test repositories for different languages and scenarios
- Security testing tools

### 8.2 Deployment Requirements
- GitHub Marketplace publishing access
- Documentation hosting
- Support channels setup

## 9. Glossary

- **Refactoring**: Restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A method of submitting contributions to a GitHub repository
- **GitHub Action**: A CI/CD feature that allows automating workflows in GitHub
- **Technical Debt**: The implied cost of additional work caused by choosing an easier solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer
